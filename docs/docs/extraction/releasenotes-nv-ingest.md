## 26.03 Release Notes (26.3.0)

NVIDIA® NeMo Retriever Library version 26.03 adds broader hardware and software support along with many pipeline, evaluation, and deployment enhancements.

To upgrade the Helm charts for this release, refer to the [NeMo Retriever Library Helm Charts](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Retriever/blob/26.3.0/helm/README.md).

Highlights for the 26.03 release include:

- NV-Ingest GitHub repo renamed to NeMo-Retriever  
- NeMo Retriever Extraction pipeline renamed to NeMo Retriever Library  
- NeMo Retriever Library now supports two deployment options:  
  - A new no-container, pip-installable in-process library for development (available on PyPI)  
  - Existing production-ready Helm chart with NIMs  
- Added documentation notes on Air-gapped deployment support  
- Added documentation notes on OpenShift support  
- Added support for RTX4500 Pro Blackwell SKU  
- Added support for llama-nemotron-embed-vl-v2 in text and text+image modes  
- New extract methods `pdfium_hybrid` and `ocr` target scanned PDFs to improve text and layout extraction from image-based pages  
- VLM-based image caption enhancements:  
  - Infographics can be captioned  
  - Reasoning mode is configurable  
- Enabled hybrid search with Lancedb  
- Added retrieval_bench subfolder with generalizable agentic retrieval pipeline  
- The project now uses UV as the primary environment and package manager instead of Conda, resulting in faster installs and simpler dependency handling  
- Default Redis TTL increased from 1–2 hours to 48 hours so long-running jobs (e.g., VLM captioning) don’t expire before completion  
- NeMo Retriever Library currently does not support image captioning via VLM; this feature will be added in the next release
