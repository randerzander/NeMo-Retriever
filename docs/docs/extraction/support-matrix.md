# Support Matrix for NeMo Retriever Library

Before you begin using [NeMo Retriever Library](overview.md), ensure that you have the hardware for your use case.

!!! note

    NVIDIA Ingest (nv-ingest) has been renamed NeMo Retriever Library.


## Core and Advanced Pipeline Features

The Nemo Retriever Library extraction core pipeline features run on a single A10G or better GPU. 
The core pipeline features include the following:

- llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2 — Embedding model for converting text chunks into vectors.
- nemotron-page-elements-v3 — Detects and classifies images on a page as a table, chart or infographic.
- nemotron-table-structure-v1 — Detects rows, columns, and cells within a table to preserve table structure and convert to Markdown format. 
- nemotron-graphic-elements-v1 — Detects graphic elements within chart images such as titles, legends, axes, and numerical values. 
- nemotron-ocr-v1 — Image OCR model to detect and extract text from images.
- retrieval — Enables embedding and indexing into Milvus.

Advanced features require additional GPU support and disk space. 
This includes the following:

- Audio extraction - parakeet-1-1b-ctc-en-us — Use the [Parakeet CTC English (en-US) ASR NIM](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/speech/latest/asr/deploy-asr-models/parakeet-ctc-en-us.html) (`nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/parakeet-1-1b-ctc-en-us`) for processing audio files. For more information, refer to [Audio Processing](audio.md).
- Advanced visual parsing — Use [nemotron-parse](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/vision-language-models/latest/examples/nemotron-parse/overview.html), which adds state-of-the-art text and table extraction. For more information, refer to [Advanced Visual Parsing ](nemoretriever-parse.md).
- VLM — Use [nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl/modelcard) for experimental image captioning of unstructured images. 
    
    !!! note
    
        While nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl is the default VLM, you can configure and use other vision language models for image captioning based on your specific use case requirements. For more information, refer to [Extract Captions from Images](nv-ingest-python-api.md#extract-captions-from-images).

- Reranker — Use [llama-3.2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2) for improved retrieval accuracy.

¹ Audio runs but requires runtime engine build — no pre-defined model profile.

² Nemotron Parse fails to start on 32GB, pending engineering investigation.

³ VLM fails to load on 32GB, 32GB is below the minimum threshold.

\* GPUs with less than 80GB VRAM cannot run the reranker concurrently with the core pipeline. 
To perform recall testing with the reranker on these GPUs, shut down the core pipeline NIM microservices 
and run only the embedder, reranker, and your vector database.
